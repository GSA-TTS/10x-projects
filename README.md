### Small bets mean incremental investments in projects that keep delivering value and high impact

10x is like a venture studio within the federal government. Traditionally found in the private sector, venture studios are investment offices within a larger business or organization. 10x sources ideas across government, places small bets on risky projects, and eventually hands off a service or product to a long-term steward for ongoing maintenance.

Weâ€™ve integrated a lot of these private sector practices within a federal government context. We prioritize ideas that align with 10x's investment priorities. And using a phased approach, we vet in-flight projects continuously, and only continue funding if projects continue to demonstrate impact and deliver value.
